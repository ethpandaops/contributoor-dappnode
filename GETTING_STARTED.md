## Welcome to Contributoor

Contributoor is a monitoring and data-gathering tool that helps improve Ethereum’s network visibility while running seamlessly alongside your beacon node.

Contributoor runs as a sidecar process to your beacon node, collecting important metrics and events without impacting your node’s performance. It:

- Connects to your beacon node’s API
- Monitors key events and metrics
- Securely forwards data to ethPandaOps collection endpoints

By offering Contributoor, we hope to empower the Ethereum community to gather valuable insights and drive meaningful improvements to the network.
